\frametitle{What is Random Number Generation?}
\textbf{Intuition:} Random Number Generator is a device that generates a sequence of numbers or symbols that \textit{cannot be predicted better than by random chance}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Application of Random Numbers}
Depending on the field of application, criteria for randomness can differ
\begin{itemize}
\item Cryptography: the most "demanding" area
\item Statistical Sampling: lower standarts for randomness
\item Monte--Carlo Methods
\item Gambling 
\item Computer Simulation
\end{itemize}
}

\frametitle{Simple examples of (seemingly) random sequences}
Random sequences should not follow any recognizable pattern. How these sequences can be produced?\\
\bigskip
\textbf{Linear Congruential Generator}
\smallskip
\begin{align}
X_{n+1}=(aX_n+b) \mod m \notag
\end{align}
where\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\emph{a}\), \(\emph{b}\), and \(\emph{m}\) are large integers
    \item\(X_{n+1}\) is the next member of the sequence
     \item The maximum number of numbers formula can produce is \(\emph{m-1}\)
\end{itemize} 

}

\textbf{Middle Square Method}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{MSM.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Drawbacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Short period}
        \item{The output converges to zero} 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
\frametitle{Simple examples of (seemingly) random sequences}
\textbf{Mersenne Twister}
\smallskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Default RNG in Python, R, Ruby, PHP, Stata and some other languages
\item Statistical quality is NOT sufficient for cryptography 
\item Repeat itself after tens thousands of trials
\item Computer's real time clock is used as a seed (milliseconds precision)
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Methods and Algorithms of PRNG}
\textbf{Mersenne Twister: Advantages}
\smallskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Relatively fast comparing to other
\item Has a long period which is \( 2^{19937}-1\) (it is not a guarantee of quality) 
\item \(k\)-distributed to 32-bit accuracy for every \( 1\leq k \leq623 \) (uniformly distributed in 623 dimensions)
\item Passes numerous tests for randomness (for example Diehard tests)
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{
\frametitle{Algorithm-Based Random Number Generators}

\begin{itemize}
\item Middle Square Method, Mersenne Twister and Linear Congruential Methods are using algorithms to produce the sequence of seemingly random numbers
\item These sequences are deterministic: they can be predicted, if we know the algorithm and the \emph{seed}
\item A \emph{seed} or a \emph{key} is the first element, from which the computation of the sequence of random numbers starts
\item And they are always periodic (pattern starts to repeat)
\item That is why the number produced are not truly random, but pseudo random
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{quote} \textbf{Anyone who considers arithmetic methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of a sin.} For [...] there is no such thing as a random number -- there are only methods to produce random numbers, and a strict arithmetic procedure of course is not such a method.\end{quote}

\section{Tests for Randomness}
\frame{
\frametitle{Tests for Randomness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical properties must be the same as for the sequence of \textbf{i.i.d. uniformly distributed random variables} 
    \item Test for randomness are the test which measure the quality of random numbers.
\end{itemize}
Two examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item Diehards tests: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item introduced in 1995 by George Marsaglia
        \item contains 12 tests
        \item Mersenne Twister passes all of them
    \end{itemize}
\item Wald--Wolfowitz runs test
\begin{itemize}
\item non-parametric statistical test
\item checks if elements of a two-valued sequence are mutually independent
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


\section{Random- and Pseudo Random Number Generators}
\frame{
\frametitle{Random- and Pseudo Random Number Generators}
\begin{itemize}
\item To make a sequence truly random, we need a source of entropy
\item The sources of "truly" random numbers are hardware random number generators
\item As the sources of entropy they are having physical processes, either of micro or micro scale
\begin{itemize}
    \item thermal noise
    \item cosmic background radiation
    \item radioactive decay
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Random- and Pseudo Random Number Generators}
It is possible to use a combined approach:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use PRNG algorithm seeded by the source of outer entropy
    \item Make a hybrid which uses the source of naturally occurring entropy when it is available and switches to algorithmic PRNG when the level of entropy drops
\end{enumerate}
